# Prodigy-Infotech
üöÄ During my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I successfully developed and deployed four diverse web projects that strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
1Ô∏è‚É£ A responsive Landing Page showcasing modern design principles with clean UI/UX.
2Ô∏è‚É£ An interactive Tic Tac Toe Game built with dynamic gameplay and optimized logic.
3Ô∏è‚É£ A functional Weather App that fetches real-time data using APIs to display accurate weather information.
4Ô∏è‚É£ A Stopwatch Application with start, pause, reset, and lap-time functionalities for precise time tracking.

These projects not only enhanced my technical expertise but also gave me hands-on experience in creating practical, user-friendly web applications.
